He told me how long it would take and we agreed a price I was comfortable paying. He came on the morning agreed - the job involved sealing a hole so regarded multiple coats of plaster and filler. Fredi came regularly to apply a new coat doing more than we agreed as he wanted to ensure the job was done properly. The ceiling now looks back to normal and I will definitely contact him for any further jobs. Thanks Fredi.
