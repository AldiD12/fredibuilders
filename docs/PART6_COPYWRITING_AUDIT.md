**Site:** fredibuilders.co.uk  
**Audit Date:** February 22, 2026  
**Focus:** Premium copywriting for wealthy London homeowners

---

## 1. Tone of Voice Assessment

### ✅ Current Tone (GOOD)
The site uses consultative, premium language throughout:

**Homepage Example:**
- "Expert bathroom renovations with meticulous attention to detail"
- "9.6/10 Checkatrade score with 104+ verified reviews"
- "British Standard certified"

**Location Pages:**
- "Luxury Bathroom Renovations in {Location}"
- "Flawless finishes and meticulous attention to detail"
- "£2M Public Liability Insurance"

**Score:** 9/10 ✅

**Minor Issue:** Some pages could emphasize "peace of mind" more than technical specs.

---

## 2. Hero Section (3-Second Pitch)

### Current Implementation

**Homepage H1:** "Bathroom Fitters Surrey & SW London | 104 Verified Reviews"
**Sub-headline:** "Expert bathroom renovations, wet rooms & luxury tiling"
**Trust Signals:** "9.6/10 Checkatrade | £2M Insured | 104+ Happy Clients | 15+ Years"

### ✅ Strengths:
- Clear geographic targeting
- Social proof prominent
- Trust signals visible

### ⚠️ Improvements Needed:
- H1 is SEO-focused, not benefit-focused
- Missing "differentiator" statement
- Could be more consultative

### Recommended Hero Section:

**H1:** "Luxury Bathroom Renovations in Surrey & South London"

**Sub-headline:** "Transforming homes with flawless finishes and meticulous craftsmanship. From Victorian terrace renovations to modern wet rooms, we deliver dust-free installations on time and on budget."

**Trust Micro-Copy:** "⭐ 9.6/10 Checkatrade Rating | £2M Public Liability Insurance | 12-Month Guarantee"

**Score:** 7/10 ⚠️

---

## 3. Pain & Agitation Section

### ❌ MISSING - Critical Gap

**Current:** Site jumps straight to services without addressing fears.

**Wealthy Client Fears:**
1. Mess and dust in expensive homes
2. Projects dragging on for weeks
3. Hidden costs and price increases
4. Unreliable tradesmen
5. Poor communication

### Recommended Section (Add to Homepage):

**H2:** "Tired of Unreliable Bathroom Fitters in {Region}?"

**Copy:**
"Inviting contractors into your home shouldn't be stressful. Most homeowners in Surrey and South London worry about dust damaging expensive furnishings, projects overrunning by weeks, and the dreaded 'hidden extra costs' appearing at the end.

At Fredi Builders, we operate differently. We use industrial-grade dust extraction systems, protect every surface with heavy-duty sheeting, and the fixed price we quote is exactly what you pay. No surprises, no excuses."

**Score:** 0/10 ❌ (Section doesn't exist)

## 4. Brand Dropping Authority

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Whether it's a rainfall shower system or heated marble flooring, we specify the right products for lasting luxury and durability."

**Brands to Name-Drop:**

## 6. Objection Handling (FAQs)

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ Strengths:

- "Can I stay in my home during the work?"

### Recommended Additional FAQs:

**Q: "Will there be dust everywhere?"**
A: "We use industrial-grade dust extraction systems and seal off work areas with heavy-duty plastic sheeting. While some dust is inevitable in renovation work, we minimize it to levels that won't affect the rest of your home. We also vacuum and clean at the end of each day."

**Q: "Can I stay in my home during the work?"**
A: "Yes. Most of our clients remain in their homes during bathroom renovations. We work in contained areas, maintain access to other facilities where possible, and keep disruption to an absolute minimum. For full-house projects, we can discuss phased approaches."

**Q: "How do you protect expensive flooring and furniture?"**
A: "We treat your home with the same care we'd treat our own. All floors are covered with heavy-duty protective sheeting, furniture is wrapped and moved carefully, and we use corner protectors when moving materials through your home."
