6. THE "SUNK COST" LEAD GENERATOR (CRO)
Standard contact forms are boring. We use psychological friction to our advantage.
[ ] The Multi-Step Logic:
Step 1: "What is your project?" (Visual buttons: Bathroom, Extension, RSJ).
Step 2: "What is your Postcode?" (Validates local intent).
Step 3: "Upload a photo for a priority estimate." (High-intent trigger).
Step 4: "Where should we send your fixed-price quote?"
[ ] The "Fast-Track" Messaging:
Next to the form, add: "Average response time for [Location] residents: 45 minutes."
Why: It creates a sense of immediate service and local priority.
17. BEHAVIORAL "STICKINESS" (Dwell Time)
Google tracks how long someone stays. If they stay, you rank higher.
[ ] The Video "Time-Trap":
Embed a 60-second "Process Video" (Fredi on-site, dust-sheets being laid, final polish).
Technical: Lazy-load the YouTube/Vimeo iframe so it doesn't slow down the LCP.
[ ] The "Dynamic Case Study" Sidebar:
On the Esher page, the sidebar shouldn't just be links. It should show a "Mini-Case Study": 'Last month in Esher: We saved a Victorian terrace from a leaking wet room. View Project.'
18. THE "FORBIDDEN" SCALING (Black/Gray Hat)
This is the "Nuclear Option" for when you want to crush established competitors fast.
[ ] Expired Domain "Redirect" (The Authority Heist):
Find an old UK building company domain that went bust but has links from The Evening Standard or BBC.
The Move: 301 Redirect that domain to your Service Hub page.
Result: You "inherit" their 10+ years of domain age and trust.
[ ] Barnacle SEO (The Monopoly):
Don't just rank your site. Rank your Checkatrade and Yell profiles too.
The Move: Point 2-3 high-quality backlinks to your Checkatrade profile.
Result: You own Position #1 (Website) and Position #3 (Checkatrade). You take up 50% of the screen.
19. E-E-A-T: THE "HUMAN ENTITY" (Google Trust)
Google doesn't rank "Sites," it ranks "Entities." You must prove Fredi is a real expert.
[ ] The "Person" Schema:
Create an About the Founder section.
Inject Person Schema linking Fredi's name to his Checkatrade ID, LinkedIn, and VAT registration.
Why: Google connects the "Code" to a "Human." This makes you "Update-Proof."
[ ] The "Consultative" Advice Hub:
Every blog post (MDX) must end with: "Reviewed by Fredi Dengu, Lead Contractor at Fredi Builders."
Why: It establishes Expertise (the E in E-E-A-T).
20. THE "GMB NEURAL BRIDGE" (Local Dominance)
Finalizing the link between the Map and the Code.
[ ] The "Review-to-Page" Sync:
When you get a review from Dulwich, you don't just put it on the Review page.
The Move: You programmatically inject that specific review into the /locations/builders-in-dulwich-se21 page.
Why: Google sees the review mentions "Dulwich" and the page is about "Dulwich." The relevance score hits 100%.
